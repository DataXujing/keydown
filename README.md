# KeyDown

KeyDown is another 'Presentation System in a single HTML page' inspired by [Showoff](http://github.com/dirnic/showoff/), [Slidedown](http://github.com/nakajima/slidedown),
[HTML5 Rocks](http://studio.html5rocks.com/#Deck), with a little [Presentation Zen](http://amzn.to/8X55H2) thrown in.

In fact, to be fair, the Markdown parsing code is straight-up lifted from Slidedown. So Keydown uses & supports Slidedown's syntax.

## Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
  * Fork the project.
  * Make your feature addition or bug fix.
  * Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
  * Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history. (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
  * Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
